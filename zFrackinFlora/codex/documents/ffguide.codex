"Introduction
So, you fancy yourself a botanist? A scientist? Chemist? Whatever the case, you've a long road ahead of you. There are many things one must do in order to achieve true scientific perfection. I'll guide you through your first forays into the discipline.",

"The Extractor - Your Bestest Friend
First thing's first: You'll need a DNA Extractor. These machines are invaluable to any budding bio-engineer. You just toss whatever it is you want to pull materials from into it, press the buttons and BAM! Goodness comes out. I do, however, recommend against putting live creatures in there. Kittens extract poorly.",

"Extracted Goodies
You'll typically get one of a few things when extracting. Nutrient Paste, Tissue Cultures, Raw Minerals, Genetic Material or Oil. All have their uses, and you will definitely need some of each. Do try not to eat them.",

"Where do I find 'em?
Genetic Material is most commonly found in meats, certain plants and similar stuff. You'll find Raw Minerals in stone, ore and other things rich in mineral content. Tissue Culture is most common from plants, seeds and produce. Oil is not found in many places. Sand and Tar are your best bets.",

"The Matter Assembler
Now that you have an Extractor, you should be able to figure out how to make a Matter Assembler. You'll need this to produce your lab equipment. It is absolutely essential.",

"Glassware
You'll need vials, beakers and flasks for a good number of products as you progress. Try to keep them stocked. Glass can be created by smelting sand in a furnace.",

"Lab Space
With your Matter Assembler placed, you are probably starting to realize that you will need a substantial amount of space for your lab. Any self-respecting scientist would make room for such a glorious thing! Who DOESN'T want a lab?!?! But I get ahead of myself here...You'll be able to create several more labs now. Next up, a BioChem Lab.",

"Bio-Chemistry
The BioChem Lab is your all-in-one chemistry station. Any sort of tinkering involving formulas is done here. Likewise, you can produce some more...interesting things. Such as unstable particles for use in energy weapons. Without the formulas made here, you will not be able to create the more interesting plants.",

"Xeno-Research Lab
Now you'll need a Xeno Research Lab. This sweet baby will produce various sorts of research materials, gene sequences and other deliciously scientific things. With these, you can create plants by combining the goods in a Gene Design Lab. That's next. First, build yourself the Xeno Research Lab.",

"Designing Genes
The Gene Design Lab is your best friend. Here, you combine all the things you've made in previously built stations in order to create new seeds! Without this, you're sunk!",

"Cloning from Seeds
Finally, the Cloning Lab can be built, though it is not necessary essential. Here you can create modified versions of basic seeds, ordinary plants, and hybrid plants. Try it out!",

"Storing Your Goods
Need somewhere to store the dozens of resources you're inevitably going to create through your research? Well, the solution is simple enough: Gene Cabinets. Build a couple of these and you will be good to go. And they're cheap and easy to make!",

"Fertilizer
A large portion of recipes for research or plant seeds will require Fertilizer in order to be created. That means you'll need sulphur, oil and synthesized protein. Sulphur requires Raw Minerals and Nutrient Paste. Try making a few barrels. Try to keep your supply stocked. ",

"Experimentation
There is a lot more to learn, though the information presented thus far should be adequate to get you started. Experiment and see what you can come up with!"
